<!-- All about cats Section -->
<section class="cats-section">
    <h2>All about cats</h2>
    <p>We know that bringing your cat to the vet can be one of the most stressful events in a cat’s life. Since we’re all about reducing stress, it makes sense that we have committed to being a Cat Friendly Clinic, and are recognised by the International Society of Feline Medicine. (We might be a little bit proud to be the first in South Africa to achieve this!) We have paid attention to the unique needs of cats in every area of our practice, from the waiting area to the consulting rooms to the hospital. Every member of staff has regular training to enhance our awareness of cats, and the ways in which we can make the visit easier for you and your cat.</p>
    <p>Have a look at our CAT FRIENDLY resources, or talk to us about how we can help.</p>
